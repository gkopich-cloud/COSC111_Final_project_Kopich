# Kopich_Final COSC 111 
A Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator that prints to a png

## Made by Greg Kopich for Fall 2025

To run the program, put all files into a program that can run java(VSCode is recommended),
and run the 'Kopich_Final.java' file.
Make sure your console is open, almost all inputs are integers that corresponds to a given list, but there are some string inputs, both of which requiring keyboard input.
Once complete, view the 'output.png' file.

This program will take you through the process of making a Dungeons and Dragons character. these are the character name, level, stats, race, class, background, and spells. These should be fine editing in any order or editing previous sections. Once the program is done, you should be able to view your character sheet in the output file. 

Each setion has a default value, so you can skip over sections for testing purposes.
